Student Xingyun Poetry Club at the University of Science and Technology of China, also known as USTC Xing Yun Poetry Club, began preparations on November 18, 2020, and was officially established on September 5, 2021. It is the only club on campus devoted exclusively to the study of Chinese poetry—including both classical and modern forms. The club members embrace the mission of “inheriting poetry culture at USTC and spreading the charm of poetry.” Since its founding, the club has been committed to popularizing the art of poetry on campus and cultivating a vibrant poetic atmosphere. Under the direction of the school and departmental Youth League committees, with guidance from the club management committee and support from their instructors, and by considering its unique characteristics and practical needs, the club has purposefully, systematically, and targetedly encouraged, supported, and guided its members in the creation and appreciation of literary works, including Chinese poetry in its classical and modern forms. These efforts have not only enriched the cultural life of the campus community but also helped nurture well-rounded students with a profound poetic sensibility, further contributing to USTC’s goal of “building a world-class university.”
